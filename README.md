image_processing
================

Program does a few operations on images including: histogram stretch, balance change, vertical blur and gamma correction. Those can be done to one of 3 components from rgb pixels or to all with prior gray conversion. Moreover, program displays image and save it to specified file.  It works with every image file, but particularly with ppm, and pgm. Then it also prints the comments to the image file about the done operations.
