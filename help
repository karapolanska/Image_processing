 IMAGE PROCESSING
    Program process pgm and ppm files.
    And all other images via OpenCV library.

 CALLING:
    Program {[-i name] [-o name] [-m color] [-z number number] [-g number]
             [-ry number] [-h] [-d] }

 OPTIONS:

    The order of options is unrestricted and is saved for further processing.
    Oprations canbe repeated multiple times during one session.
    To pgm and ppm files the comments are added. They contain the information
    what was done and the date.

    -i <file_name> - name of th file to be loaded (if given '-', the file will be
     read from standard input; 
     !! From the standard input means the picture not the path !!

    -o <file_name> - name of the file to save ( if given '-', the file will be
     printed to the standard output;

    -d - after processing the image will be displayed. Works after completing all
     the operations and saving;

    -m <color> - choose color to be processed: r – red, g – green, b – blue,
     s – conversion to grays;
     may appear multiple times setting current color to be processed. The color
     is applicable till new color is specified by -m <color>.
     Only one color (or grays) can be processed at the time.
     Option is omitted for monochromatic pictures and doesn't cause error, only
     warning. If no color is specified all are processed;

    -g <ratio> - gamma correction with given ratio. Takes values higher than 0;

    -z <black> <white> - change of colors level (not only black and white).
     Black and white parameters must be replaced by numbers between 0-100 and
     white > black;

    -ry - vertical blur. Takes non-negative values. Fractions are converted to
     int;

    -h - histogram stretch. For colored images - for specified color;

    --help - displays help and closes program;

 COMMENTS:
    -Option -i must appear when launching the program. Its lack, and the lack
     of file names after -i and -o cause error message.
     Lack of -o option causes printing the image on th standard output;

    -If mor files spcified after -o or -i, only the last one is valid;
